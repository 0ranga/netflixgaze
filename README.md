# Neftlix Gaze

*A data visualization aiming at identifying the different mechanisms used by Netflix to promote content visibility.*

## About this project

This work is the result of the capstone project of my Master's Degree in Design at Pantheon Sorbonne University. It was a collaboration with researchers in Computer Science who collected a tremendous amount of data from Netflix users. 

I had the task with 3 other students ([Marvin Mayard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvin-mayard/), [Laura Swietlicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-swietlicki/) and [Thomas Roux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasxuor/)) to exploit the data collected and find a creative way to process it visually in order to highlight key information, create meaning, and gather insight.
